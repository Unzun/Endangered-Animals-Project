        <img src="images/Leatherback.webp" alt="leatherback" width="350">
        <p>Even though the leatherback sea turtle has the widest global  distribution of any reptile, its population has been <br>
            declining in many  parts of the world. One of the greatest threats comes from being  inadvertently captured in fishing 
            gear.</p>
        <img src="images/axolotol.webp" alt="axolotl" width="400">
        <p>The axolotl is severely endangered due to habitat loss, pollution, and the introduction of invasive fish that will prey <br>
            on it. Their presence in the canals of Mexico City is currently being monitored through the use of environmental DNA 
            (eDNA). </p>
        <img src="images/Panda.webp" alt="panda" width="300">
        <p>The giant panda was nearly driven to extinction through habitat loss  and poaching; an estimated 1,800 still reside <br>
            in the wild today. A system of nature reserves has been established in China to help maintain panda populations and 
            habitats. </p>
